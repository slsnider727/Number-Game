## Number Game

This pair programming project is from my first 4 weeks at Eleven Fifty Academy. I and 2 classmates built this console app game in which the player tries to guess a random number of the computer's choosing.

To play, clone the repository, open in Visual Studio Community, run the program, and you're good to go!
